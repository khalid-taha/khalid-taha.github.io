# AI-SDLC v1.0  
*A short position paper*

## Purpose

This paper proposes **AI-SDLC v1.0**, a software development lifecycle designed for a world where **AI performs most implementation work** and **humans own intent, constraints, and decisions**.

It does not promote a tool, framework, or methodology brand.  
It describes a structural shift in how software is built.

---

## The historical bottleneck

Traditional SDLCs evolved to address a single dominant constraint: **human execution**.

Historically:
- writing code was slow and expensive,
- Refactoring carries a high risk,
- coordination between people was costly,
- Late errors were hard to correct.

Processes such as Waterfall and Agile are optimised around these realities.  
Their practices exist to manage execution cost and coordination risk.

---

## What AI changed

AI collapses the implementation cost.

Today, systems can:
- generate and rewrite code quickly,
- refactor large codebases cheaply,
- produce tests and infrastructure automatically.

Execution is no longer the primary bottleneck in many environments.

---

## The new bottleneck

When execution becomes cheap, a different constraint dominates:

- unclear intent,
- weak constraints,
- untested assumptions,
- delayed or misleading feedback,
- Poor decisions made without evidence.

Speed amplifies outcomes, both good and bad.  
Building faster does not help if the direction is wrong.

The SDLC must therefore optimise for **decision quality**, not task throughput.

---

## Design goals of an AI-native SDLC

An AI-native SDLC should:

- make intent explicit before execution,
- treat constraints as enforceable system rules,
- allow implementation to be replaced easily,
- enforce quality and safety automatically,
- rely on observed runtime behaviour,
- preserve clear human accountability.

These goals define AI-SDLC v1.0.

## AI-SDLC v1.0 lifecycle

AI-SDLC v1.0 is a **closed decision loop**, not a linear delivery pipeline.

### 1. Intent
A human defines:
- the problem,
- the desired outcome,
- non-negotiable constraints,
- key assumptions,
- stop or change conditions.

### 2. Specification
The intent is expressed in a machine-readable form describing:
- behaviour and interfaces,
- data and state,
- non-functional requirements,
- acceptance scenarios,
- required observability.

### 3. Automated implementation
AI generates:
- code,
- tests,
- infrastructure,
- instrumentation,
- supporting artefacts.

Humans review outcomes rather than hand-crafting implementation.

### 4. Automated enforcement
Quality, security, performance, and cost limits are enforced automatically.  
Failures block progression.

### 5. Deployment
The system is deployed incrementally and safely.

### 6. Observation
The running system produces evidence through:
- user and system behaviour,
- reliability and performance data,
- operational cost.

### 7. Decision
A named decision owner chooses to:
- continue,
- adjust,
- stop,
- or pivot.

The decision closes the loop.

## Unit of progress

In AI-SDLC v1.0, progress is measured by **decisions informed by evidence**, not by the number of tasks completed.

Progress means:
- uncertainty was reduced,
- assumptions were tested,
- direction became clearer.

---

## Accountability

AI-SDLC v1.0 does not remove human responsibility.

Humans remain accountable for:
- intent,
- constraints,
- decisions,
- outcomes.

AI executes. Humans decide.

---

## Conclusion

AI changes the economics of software development.  
When execution is cheap, decision quality becomes the dominant factor.

AI-SDLC v1.0 aligns the SDLC with this reality by treating intent, constraints, evidence, and accountability as first-class elements, and by positioning AI as the primary executor rather than the primary decision-maker.
