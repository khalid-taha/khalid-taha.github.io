# Rethinking the Software Development Lifecycle for an AI Builder

Abstract

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) has historically been designed around the constraints of human execution. Planning frameworks, coordination mechanisms, and delivery processes emerged to manage slow, manual implementation and high integration risk. Recent advances in artificial intelligence fundamentally change these constraints. When AI systems can generate, modify, and discard code at low cost, execution ceases to be the primary bottleneck. This paper argues that the SDLC must be redesigned accordingly. It proposes AI-SDLC v1.0, a decision-driven lifecycle in which humans define intent and constraints, AI performs implementation, automated systems enforce quality and safety, and observed runtime behaviour determines direction.

1. Introduction

For decades, software delivery has been limited by the cost and risk of implementation. Writing code, integrating changes, testing, and deploying reliably required significant human effort and coordination. The SDLC evolved to manage these realities.

Artificial intelligence changes this equation. Large language models and AI-assisted tooling can now generate working systems, refactor existing codebases, and produce tests and infrastructure at speeds that were previously impractical. As a result, implementation is no longer the dominant constraint in many software projects.

This shift requires a corresponding change in how software development is organised and governed.

2. The historical SDLC constraint

Traditional SDLC models assumed:
	•	implementation was expensive and slow,
	•	errors were costly to correct late,
	•	coordination between people was a major risk,
	•	parallel work increased integration complexity.

Waterfall, Agile, and their variants are optimisations around these assumptions. Their practices—backlogs, sprint cycles, hand-offs, and ceremonies—exist primarily to manage human execution and coordination.

When these assumptions no longer hold, the effectiveness of the process degrades.

3. The impact of AI on execution cost

AI systems significantly reduce the marginal cost of:
	•	writing and rewriting code,
	•	generating tests and scaffolding,
	•	refactoring across large codebases,
	•	producing infrastructure and configuration artefacts.

As execution cost falls, new risks dominate:
	•	unclear intent,
	•	poorly defined constraints,
	•	untested assumptions,
	•	delayed or misleading feedback,
	•	decisions made without evidence.

In this environment, delivering software faster does not guarantee better outcomes. Speed amplifies both correct and incorrect decisions.

4. The new primary constraint: decision quality

In an AI-enabled environment, the dominant constraint shifts upstream:
	•	What problem should be solved?
	•	What outcome matters?
	•	What constraints must not be violated?
	•	What assumptions are being made?
	•	What evidence will justify continuing, changing, or stopping?

The SDLC must therefore optimise for decision quality, not task throughput.

⸻

5. Design goals for an AI-native SDLC

An SDLC designed for an AI builder should:
	1.	Make intent explicit before execution.
	2.	Treat constraints as enforceable system properties.
	3.	Allow implementation to be replaced without ceremony.
	4.	Enforce quality, security, and safety automatically.
	5.	Base decisions on observed system behaviour.
	6.	Maintain clear human accountability.

These goals inform AI-SDLC v1.0.

6. AI-SDLC v1.0

AI-SDLC v1.0 is a decision-driven lifecycle composed of a closed loop rather than a linear delivery pipeline.

6.1 Intent definition

A human defines:
	•	the problem being addressed,
	•	the affected users or systems,
	•	the desired outcome,
	•	non-negotiable constraints,
	•	key assumptions,
	•	conditions that would justify stopping or changing direction.

This intent is concise and explicit. No implementation begins without it.

⸻

6.2 Formal specification

The intent is translated into a machine-readable specification describing:
	•	system behaviour and interfaces,
	•	data and state,
	•	non-functional requirements,
	•	acceptance scenarios,
	•	required observability.

The specification captures assumptions and boundaries rather than promising a fixed solution.

⸻

6.3 Automated implementation

AI systems generate:
	•	application code,
	•	tests,
	•	infrastructure configuration,
	•	instrumentation,
	•	supporting documentation.

Human involvement focuses on review and judgement, not manual construction.

⸻

6.4 Automated enforcement

Automated gates enforce:
	•	correctness through tests,
	•	security and dependency controls,
	•	performance and cost limits,
	•	deployment safety mechanisms.

Failures block progression without negotiation.

⸻

6.5 Deployment

Deployment is incremental and controlled. It is treated as the start of observation rather than the end of development.

⸻

6.6 Observation

The running system produces evidence, including:
	•	user and system behaviour,
	•	reliability and performance data,
	•	operational cost,
	•	failure modes and friction points.

This evidence must be defined prior to implementation.

⸻

6.7 Decision

A named decision owner reviews the evidence and chooses one action:
	•	continue,
	•	adjust,
	•	stop,
	•	pivot.

The decision and its basis are recorded, closing the loop.

⸻

7. Unit of progress

In AI-SDLC v1.0, the primary unit of progress is a decision informed by evidence, not a completed task.

Progress is measured by:
	•	reduced uncertainty,
	•	validated or invalidated assumptions,
	•	clearer direction.

⸻

8. Accountability and roles

AI-SDLC v1.0 does not eliminate human responsibility. It clarifies it.

Required functions include:
	•	intent ownership,
	•	decision accountability,
	•	system stewardship,
	•	automated execution.

These functions may be combined or separated as appropriate.

⸻

9. Implications

AI-SDLC v1.0 does not reject prior methodologies. It recognises that they were optimised for a different constraint set. As implementation cost collapses, SDLCs must prioritise clarity, evidence, and decision-making.

Organisations that continue optimising for execution speed alone risk becoming faster at producing the wrong outcomes.

⸻

10. Conclusion

AI fundamentally alters the economics of software development. When execution is cheap, decision quality becomes the dominant factor. AI-SDLC v1.0 proposes a lifecycle aligned with this reality: one that treats intent, constraints, evidence, and accountability as first-class elements, and positions AI as the primary executor rather than the primary decision-maker.
