# Orchestrating LLMs: Building a Python Bookkeeping System with AI Collaboration

In my recent project, I embarked on an exciting journey to develop a **bookkeeping system using Python**, heavily leveraging the capabilities of a **large language model (LLM)**. The goal was to build an application and explore how LLMs can assume various roles in software development—acting as **business analysts, system designers, and code developers**.

The process began by engaging the LLM to create **user stories and tasks** and identify their dependencies. The LLM provided detailed tables outlining these dependencies, which I manually inputted into GitHub's project board. Although the automation wasn't complete, the collaboration was seamless. I structured the project board with a simple workflow:

- **User Story**
- **Backlog**
- **To-Do**
- **In Progress**
- **Testing**
- **Done**

This was supplemented with **labels and milestones**—all guided by the LLM's output.

For each user story, I asked the LLM to generate tasks, and I requested **developer instructions** for each task. Then, it produced **code snippets** by prompting the LLM to act as a developer. I was an **AI Orchestrator**, coordinating this process—copying code into **VSCode**, testing it using **scripts generated by the LLM**, and troubleshooting errors with its assistance.

The system features **APIs and dummy machine-learning plugins**, hinting at future integrations. The LLM also helped generate comprehensive **API and plugin user guides**, covering the application's **design, implementation, and testing phases**.

Throughout this experiment, I tested several **LLM models** from different providers. While some fell short, one stood out in delivering exceptional results. Although I prefer not to advertise it openly, I'm open to sharing details collaboratively. This project underscores the **potential of LLMs in software development** and the evolving role of developers in orchestrating AI capabilities.

I'm excited about where this synergy between **human coordination and AI** can lead, especially with plans to enhance the **ML plugins**. This approach doesn't replace developers but **augments our ability to build complex systems efficiently**.

You can explore the project's code on my [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/khalid-taha/bookkeeping), linked to my [**LinkedIn profile**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khalid-a-taha). I'm sharing this experience through my startup, [**RobotFace AI**](https://robotface.co.uk), as a testament to the innovative possibilities when humans and AI collaborate.
